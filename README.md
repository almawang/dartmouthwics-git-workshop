# Dartmouth WiCS Git/GitHub Workshop

## What is git? How's it different different than GitHub?
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

In layman's terms: it helps you manage changes and versions of a project, especially when working with other people.

Now [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for version control using git.

## High Level git Concepts
Projects within git are referred to as repositories or repos for short.

### Local vs. Remote

Git has two repository types: local and remote.  The local repo is on your computer for your direct use (what you work on).  The remote repo is typically elsewhere and for your indirect use, kind of like a back up that you keep updating.  Git supports multiple remote repositories.

## Getting Started
First download git if do not already have it installed. You can check by running `git` on your preferred terminal:
https://git-scm.com/

Run the following command on terminal:
```
git
```
You should get a long list of git commands and what they do. We'll go over the key ones later.

Also set up a GitHub account. Other users will search for and find you by your username (such as for class projects) so choose one that is easy to remember and type out.
https://github.com/
